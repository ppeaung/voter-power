# voter-power

Experiments on calculating voter power for various elections for the 2024 elections for each state (if there is an appropriate election in each state). 

Make sure to run scraping_util.py to have all the data from the polls up to date. The poll data will be used as the margins for both the Presidential and Senate elections. 

Note that the margins for the state legislature and House elections use the most up to date election data. For now, we have opted to either use the Congressional Election data, if it's available, or the Presidential election.
